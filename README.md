# ðŸ“§ Bayesian Spam Filter

**NOTE:** This project was developed as a hobby while learning a course on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

An implementation of a Spam Filter using the Naive Bayes model to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam).

The system uses:

Basic NLP techniques for preprocessing (stopword removal, stemming, etc.)

CountVectorizer for converting text into numerical features

MultinomialNB for training the spam classifier

Text is preprocessed using the nltk library to remove noise and normalize inputs

## ðŸ§° Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Pickle (for model serialization)
